My experiences made me realise that my training in terms of my specialisation at the WVSU is critically insufficient if I aim to be employed in prestigious institutions after graduating. Nevertheless, the pedagogical knowledge I learned definitely saved me a lot of times. 
I hope through this tracer study, the college will initiate an action to review the curriculum of secondary teacher education focusing on the balance between pedagogy and mastery of specialisation. This has been mentioned by many students and alumni; even those who graduated earlier than our batch. Leaders in the college do not seem to pay attention to this. I kindly suggest the college to do benchmarking in other CTE universities in the Philippines. Most of these universities produce graduates with a good mix of pedagogical skills and mastery of specialisation. I can attest to that because I have had graduate school classmates and colleagues who graduated from these institutions. I hope WVSU, specifically the COE, can help their graduates enter the real world with more confidence and competence; which is not solely from the name of the school but because of the graduates' awareness of their knowledge, skills and competence; which they can, not just brag about, but demonstrate in their workplaces and schools.

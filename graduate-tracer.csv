My experiences made me realise that my training in terms of my specialisation at the WVSU is critically insufficient if I aim to be employed in prestigious institutions after graduating. Nevertheless, the pedagogical knowledge I learned definitely saved me a lot of times. 
I hope through this tracer study, the college will initiate an action to review the curriculum of secondary teacher education focusing on the balance between pedagogy and mastery of specialisation. This has been mentioned by many students and alumni; even those who graduated earlier than our batch. Leaders in the college do not seem to pay attention to this. I kindly suggest the college to do benchmarking in other CTE universities in the Philippines. Most of these universities produce graduates with a good mix of pedagogical skills and mastery of specialisation. I can attest to that because I have had graduate school classmates and colleagues who graduated from these institutions. I hope WVSU, specifically the COE, can help their graduates enter the real world with more confidence and competence; which is not solely from the name of the school but because of the graduates' awareness of their knowledge, skills and competence; which they can, not just brag about, but demonstrate in their workplaces and schools.

Some things we learned in college are way too idealistic to be applied in real life. Some experiences inside the classroom are ""taliwas sa aming natutunan"", in which you cannot be idealistic all the time. You really have to do what you are supposed to do in order to fit into the reality inside the classroom. Talking or sharing your real experiences while connecting to lessons for education students is a must for me. Sadyang maaaply talaga ito if you are in the field. One day you'll get to say, ""This is really what my teacher said to us"". Now, it's my time to shine."" Like that.??

ICT- introduce helpful applications tha can help a teacher's everyday life. There are some students pa gid nga need help diri like Excel(computing grades), Docs, PPT, and other online apps that will make their classroom experience easy, fun and motivational soon if ara na sla sa field.  Please need gid ni. ??

More on real life application gid. Demo, demo, demo. Miski daw maigod na kami sang una sang halay demo, but in the end, boom grabe gid ka helpful. Thank you gid sa teachers namon! Loveyou all! ????????

The curriculum should also focus on enhancing the technical skills of the students, like how to use Google Forms, Canva, Excel, etc. For those who are pursuing teaching as their profession, their curriculum must focus on how to level up their teaching skills. It would be better if, during their first year in school, they were already exposed to the real classroom and school setup. In this way, they would really grow and see what works and what doesn't. They will also see what traits are still missing that they need to improve. Feeding students with theories will not work, but if they get real experience, they will learn and reflect a lot. As soon as they graduate, they are fully ready to teach, and we can have more great teachers in our country.",carbonillajezel3@gmail.com,2022,
